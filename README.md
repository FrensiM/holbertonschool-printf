# Project

This is our Holberton School project from **Patrik Shalsi**, **Frensi Meta** and **Klajdi Dhana**.

# Printf in the C Programming Language

This project is about us recreating the C library function ```printf```. This function sends formatted output to ```stdout``` (which is the standard output stream) by formatting the argument(s) passed in and converting the argument(s) into a character string.

## How to Use

To use the ```printf``` function we need the repository into our directory.

```
git@github.com:Patr1k00/holbertonschool-printf.git
```

## Use in Code

### How to use ```printf``` in code

Please see the following example when printf is implemented in your code:

```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
  printf("I am printing a %s sentence.\n", "simple");
  return (0):
}

This is an example output after you run the program: 

```
$ I am printing a simple sentence.
```
